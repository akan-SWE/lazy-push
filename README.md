# Easy Git Push Script

This script simplifies the process of pushing your changes to a Git repository. It automates adding files, committing changes, and pushing to a remote repository. After following the setup steps, you'll be able to use the script from anywhere in your terminal.

## Getting Started

**Clone the Repository:**

Clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/mosescode1/lazy-push.git
````
**Run the Installation Script:**

- Navigate into the cloned repository directory.
- Run the installation script install.sh:

````bash
./install.sh
````
The script would create a hard link, so git-push can be accessed everywhere.

**Start Using the Script:**

Once the installation script has been executed, you can now use the Git push script from anywhere in your terminal.

Run the script to automate the process of adding changes, committing, and pushing to the remote repository:

````bash
git-push
````
